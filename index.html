          December 31, 2019 The government in Wuhan, China, on December 31
          reported that thousands of cases were being handled by health
          authorities. Days later, Chinese researchers found a new virus that
          had infected hundreds of Asians. There was no suggestion at the time
          that the virus was being spread readily by humans. Health officials in
          China have said they are monitoring it to prevent the outbreak from
          becoming more serious.

          January 11, 2020 On January 11, state-run Chinese media announced the
          first confirmed death from a virus-caused illness that had infected
          thousands. The 61-year-old man who died on the market in Wuhan was a
          frequent customer, and had previously been found to have abdominal
          tumors and chronic liver disease. The announcement of his death came
          just before one of the biggest holidays in China, when hundreds of
          millions travel across the world.

          January 31, 2020 The Trump administration barred all foreign nationals
          who had traveled to China over the past 14 days, except the immediate
          family members of American citizens or permanent residents, from entry
          into the United States. On this date, there had been 213 deaths and
          nearly 9,800 infections worldwide.

          Febuary 2, 2020 A 44-year-old man in the Philippines died after he was
          infected, officials said the first death outside of China was
          recorded. At this point, there had been more than 360 deaths.

          March 26/27, 2020 With at least 81,321 confirmed infections and more
          than 1,000 deaths, the United States officially became the nation
          hardest hit by the pandemic. That has been more documented than in
          China, Italy or any other country. Mr. Trump signed a $2 trillion bill
          to respond to the pandemic coronavirus. Lawmakers said the bill was
          flawed but necessary to counter the national public health and
          economic crises, passed with strong support.

          April 2, 2020 By April 2, the pandemic had sickened more than 1
          million people across six continents in 171 nations, killing at least
          51,000. In just a few weeks, the pandemic forced nearly 10 million
          Americans out of jobs, including a record 6.6 million people who
          applied for unemployment compensation during the last week of March.
          The pace and scale of work losses was unprecedented: in 1982 the worst
          week for jobless filings was 695,000 before March.
